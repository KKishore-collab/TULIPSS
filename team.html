<h3 class="rnt"> K KISHORE | PRODUCTION MANAGER </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="tnt">Kishore discovered his love for events back in high school with producing Battle of the Bands and spring concerts that featured local musical acts. After pursuing a degree in marketing at CSUN, he began managing hospitality and security for venues around Chennai. During this time, he was also regularly on the road working as a tour manager, production manager, audio engineer, lighting designer, and merchandise manager. In the last five years, Kishore has transitioned his expertise into large scale event and festival production, while operating an Audie award winning recording studio. 

        He has worked for venues such as The Penthouse at the Huntley Hotel, The Edison, The Highlands Nightclub, The Glendon Bar and Kitchen, and Elevate Lounge; and produced activations at Coachella, Lollapalooza, Outside Lands, Shaky Knees Fest, The Vans Warped Tour, and more.
        
        With a total of eight years venue management, 14 years in the touring industry, and 4 years of experiential marketing activations at festivals around the country, there isn't a problem that could arise for which Kishore won't have a solution. </p>
